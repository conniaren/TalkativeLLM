<Header> Talkative LLM </Header>
Talkative LLM is a side project where I attempt to create a Voice-based AI assistant using and combining premade generative models. 
It is built upon a large language model, Llama3, alongside a automatic speech recognition system, using Whisper AI. 
The results of Llama are then outputted using a TTS model, xTTS by Coquis AI. 

Talkative LLM works but has very slow latency (especially at the TTS stage) when run on a local CPU.
